This page is split into two groups: the contributors to the effort to
update Version 2.0 of this guide to version 3.0 and beyond, and the
acknowledgements outlined by Sigma in his final Version 2.0 release.

## The 83PA28D Project Contributors

The following individuals have contributed modifications to the project.

 * Peter "Tari" Marheine
 * Thomas "elfprince" Dickerson
 * Jon "Jonimus/TheStorm" Sturm
 * Christopher "Kerm Martian" Mitchell
 * Zachary "Runer112" Wassall

## Version 2.0

*Humorously*, I have grouped acknowledgements into categories based on
the answer to this question: "Hypothetically, if I were to go back in
time and murder \_\_\_\_\_\_'s parents/grandparents, what would be the
impact on this guide?"

### "It would be but a shadow of its current self"

<div class="no-pop">
Texas Instruments
:    For creating the calculator (natch ;-), and the SDK guide, the System
     Routine documentation, and the TI83PLUS.INC file.
Randall Hyde
:    Art of Assembly is a great book. Much of the new material from v0.95 and
     later exists because of the information in it. In fact, you could say
     this is sort of a ~~blatant rip-off~~ homage to AoA.
Patai Gergely
:    For his incredible [Z80 assembly guide](http://sgate.emt.bme.hu/patai/publications/z80guide/).
James Matthews
:    He gets in, because I was so dissatisfied with AsmGuru that I decided to
     start this project. Hahahahahaha!!!

### "It'd be a lot uglier, that's for sure"

<div class="no-pop">
Ingyu Kang
:    [Crimson Editor](http://www.crimsoneditor.com), the greatest text editor
     that ever was.
Lucas Yerpe
:    For being damn near the only person in the world who bothered to find
     mistakes and tell me about them. Thanks for helping to bring this one
     step closer to perfection, Luke.
Jimi Malcolm
:    For his [TI-86 assembly guide](http://guide.ticalc.org).

### "Frankly, I doubt anyone would have noticed"

Seriously, while they are responsible for only minor contributions
(often ones they are unaware of), they deserve thanks nonetheless
