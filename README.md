## Compilation

If you did not acquire this guide from a distribution package, you will need
to compile the components which are written in Markdown into HTML for viewing.
First ensure [Pandoc] is installed on your system, then run either `make.bat`
(on Windows) or `make` (most UNIX-like systems) to compile all the Markdown
files.

Once compiled, any or all of the `.md` files can be safely deleted.
