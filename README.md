## Compilation

If you did not acquire this guide from a distribution package, you will need
to compile the site into a collection of HTML files. For this we use [Hugo][hugo].

[hugo]: https://gohugo.io/

From the root directory of the project (where this file lives), simply run
`hugo` to generate the web site to a `public` directory. You can also use
`hugo serve` to serve the contents "on the fly."

## Viewing

This guide should display properly in any reasonably modern web browser,
and degrade gracefully under others (within reason). The following browsers
are recommended:

 * Firefox 3.5+
 * Chrome / Chromium (any version)
 * Internet Explorer 9+
 * Opera 10+
 * Safari 5+
