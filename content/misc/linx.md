## Official Stuff

### TI

TI published an official software development kit for the 83 Plus long ago, but
tend to pretend it never existed these days. Fortunately, the documentation
still exists and can be easily browsed on the Internet Archive.

 * The [SDK Guide](https://archive.org/details/83psdk/sdk83pguide) describes the
   overall system architecture.
 * The [System Routines Reference](https://archive.org/details/83psdk/83psysroutines)
   documents many of the available `b_call`s, but not all of them (presumably
   because TI didn't intend the undocumented ones for use outside of the OS).
 * Some additional [unsupported
   documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20050410221541/http://education.ti.com/us/resources/developer/83/download/unsupported.html)
   was provided, documenting other interesting system parts that TI didn't
   bother writing the documentation for themselves.

### Zilog

The creators of the Z80 processor, Zilog, of course provide their own
[documentation for how the processor
works](https://zilog.com/docs/z80/UM0080.pdf). Many of the details aren't
important if you're simply writing software for it, but is helpful as "word of
god" for what the CPU should do (though it's not always correct!).

## Community

**[WikiTI](https://wikiti.brandonw.net/)** is *the* premier community reference
resource for all TI calculators. Things that TI have documented are mostly
not covered on WikiTI, but it has a huge amount of reverse-engineered hardware
and OS documentation.

While communities of calculator programmers have waned in the decades since the
devices were first introduced, there are still some active ones:

* [ticalc.org](https://www.ticalc.org/) is one of the oldest calculator web
  sites that continues to exist, with a large number of programs, some
discussion and documentation.
* [Cemetech](https://www.cemetech.net/) has an active discussion forum and
  community mostly centered around calculators but also other adjacent topics.
Also has a copy of the new-defunct
[United-TI](https://www.cemetech.net/projects/uti/) forums.
* [TI-Planet](https://tiplanet.org/) is another active forum and community, with
  more of a French-speaking and European focus.
* [CodeWalrus](https://codewalr.us/) is a newer forum and community with
  significant overlap between it and others.
