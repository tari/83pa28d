## Code

All assembly language is given in a monospaced font, and it is usually
colored for easier reading.
Fully working programs are titled **Program *chapter*-X**.

    .nolist
    #include "ti83plus.inc"
    #define  ProgStart    $9D95
    .list
    .org ProgStart - 2
    .DB  t2ByteTok,tAsmCmp
        b_call(_ClrLCDFull)
        ld   hl,0
        ld   (PenCol),hl
        ld   hl,msg
        b_call(_PutS)       ; Display the text
        b_call(_NewLine)
        ret
    msg:
        .db "Hello world!",0
    .end
    .end

## Instructions

Details about an assembly instruction are given in a contrasting box:

{{% infobox "CP { imm8 | reg8 | (HL) }" %}}
Subtracts the operand from the accumulator, but does not actually
*affect* the accumulator.

S
:    affected

Z
:    affected

P/V
:    detects overflow

C
:    affected
{{% /infobox %}}

The first line provides the instruction's name and operands, then a short
description of its effect. Subsequent lines specify the effect on the flag
bits.  When the instruction gives operands in the form `{ foo | bar | baz }`,
then you choose one of the options delimited by the vertical bars.

 * An operand of `reg8` represents any 8-bit register except `F` `R` `I`.
 * An operand of `reg16` represents any 16-bit register except `AF`, `IX`, `IY`
   (unless otherwise noted).
 * An operand of `regindex` represents either `IX` or `IY`
 * An operand of `imm` represents an immediate value or constant (usually
   either a number or a label).

## ROM calls

Details about a ROM call are also given in a contrasting box:

{{% infobox _FormReal "Converts the number in OP1 into a string." %}}
Input
:   OP1
    :    Number

    A
    :    Maximum number of characters (not digits) to display, minimum of
         six.

Output
:   BC
    :    Length of string

    OP3
    :    Start of string, null-terminated.

Destroys
:   All

Remarks
:   SCI, ENG and FIX settings affect the string conversion. To ignore all
    format settings, use `FormEReal`.
{{% /infobox %}}
    
 * **Inputs** are the registers and memory locations that contain routine
   input parameters.
 * **Outputs** are the registers and memory locations that contain routine
   results.
 * The **Destroys** line indicates which registers and variables are set
   to an unknown state. "All" is shorthand for the registers AF BC DE HL,
   and maybe IX. I'm not sure. (stupid TI...)
 * **Remarks** are additional, helpful information.
