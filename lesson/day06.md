##What Is A Stack?

A stack is a type of data structure that is used to store items of data.
Now the interesting thing about a stack is that it has no fixed size, it
can shrink down until it comprises zero bytes, or it can grow until it
takes up all of addressable memory. Stacks are usually confined to a
smallish section of memory (since it wouldn't be a very good thing to
have a stack overwrite your program, would it :-)

##How A Stack Works

All stacks operate in a Last-in-first-out manner. What that means is
that the last item to be placed onto a stack ("pushed") is the first
item that is taken off ("popped"). Think of it as like one of those
dinner plate wells you see in buffets. Each plate is the value of a
register pair. If you store a new plate on top of the stack, you have to
push down all the others. If you remove a plate, the stack pops up. Now,
if you wanted to remove a plate that wasn't the topmost one, you
couldn't get it directly because the whole stack is sunken into the
counter. You would first have to remove all the plates on top of it.

##What You Need to Make A Stack

Ok, you know how a stack works, and now you want to make one. To have a
fully operational stack structure you need two things: a chunk of memory
the stack can exist in, and a stack pointer. The stack pointer is a
variable that tracks the address of the next free byte or the topmost
entry, either will work fine.\
 A stack can change size in two ways. Either it can grow up (new stack
entries exist at higher addresses than previous ones) or down (new stack
entries exist at lower addresses than previous ones).

Here is a pictorial example of a stack that grows up. The top of the
stack is currently address \$1009 and this is also the value of the
stack pointer. If we were to push an entry onto this stack, we would
write to \$1009. As this action would move the stack top one byte
forward, the stack pointer must then be incremented so that it once
again points to the top of the stack. On the flip side, if we wished to
pop an entry off this stack, we first decrement the stack pointer
because it currently points to nothing, then read from that address.

| \$1000 | \$1001 | \$1002 | \$1003 | \$1004 | \$1005 | \$1006 | \$1007 | \$1008 | \$1009          | \$100A | \$100B | \$100C | \$100D |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|--------|--------|-------|------|
|       |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        | stack<br>pointer|        |        |     |   | 
| \$8C  | \$DB   | \$FA   | \$47   | \$46   | \$1F   | \$0D   | \$B8   | \$03   |                 |        |        |     |   |

Example: Push the DE register onto a stack that grows up.

        LD     HL, (stack_ptr)    ; Load stack pointer
        LD     (HL), E            ; Push the low-order byte
        INC    HL                ; Move stack pointer to next byte of available space
        LD     (HL), D            ; Push the high-order byte
        INC    HL
        LD     (stack_ptr), HL    ; Save new stack pointer

Example: Pop into DE the top 16 bits off a stack that grows up.

        LD     HL, (stack_ptr)
        DEC    HL                ; Move stack pointer to next byte on stack
        LD     D, (HL)            ; Pop the high-order byte
        DEC    HL
        LD     E, (HL)            ; Pop the low-order byte
        LD     (stack_ptr), HL    ; Save new stack pointer

What about a stack that grows down? The same rules apply, we just change
the direction the stack pointer moves. In the picture the top of the
stack is currently address \$FF00 and this once again must be the value
of the stack pointer. If we were to push an entry onto this stack, we
would decrement the stack pointer so it pointed to an empty slot, then
write to it.

| \$FEFA | \$FEFB | \$FEFC | \$FEFD | \$FEFE | \$FEFF | \$FF00 | \$FF01 | \$FF02 | \$FF03 | \$FF04 | \$FF05 | \$FF06 | \$FF07 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|        |        |        |        |        |   |stack<br>pointer |    |        |        |        |        |        |        |
|        |        |        |        |        |   |   \$8C          | \$DB | \$FA |   \$47 |  \$46  |  \$1F  |   \$0D |   \$B8 | 

Example: Push the DE register onto a stack that grows down.

        LD     HL, (stack_ptr)
        DEC    HL                ; Move stack pointer to next byte of available space
        LD     (HL), D            ; Push the high-order byte
        DEC    HL
        LD     (HL), E            ; Push the low-order byte
        LD     (stack_ptr), HL    ; Save new stack pointer

Example: Pop the top 16 bits of a register that grows down into DE

        LD     HL, (stack_ptr)
        LD     E, (HL)            ; Pop the low-order byte
        INC    HL
        LD     D, (HL)            ; Pop the high-order byte
        INC    HL
        LD     (stack_ptr), HL    ; Save new stack pointer

##The Z80's Stack

Stacks are very useful data structures. So much so that almost every
computer has specific instructions that operate with a stack mentality.

`PUSH reg16`
:   Stores `reg16` to the stack. 
    `reg16` is *any* 16-bit register.

`POP reg16`
:   Retrieves `reg16` from the stack.
    `reg16` is *any* 16-bit register.

There is a special 16-bit register called SP that the Z80 uses as the
hardware stack pointer. The hardware stack (or just "the stack" for
short) is defined on the TI-83 Plus as a block of memory about 400 bytes
in size. This stack usually starts at \$0000 so as to place at the very
end of memory (the first push to the stack decrements the stack pointer
causing it to wrap around to \$FFFF). From this you could determine that
PUSH HL is equivalent to the discrete instructions (assuming for a
second that we could do LD (SP), H).

        DEC   SP
        LD    (SP), H
        DEC   SP
        LD    (SP), L

And that POP HL is identical to

        LD    L, (SP)
        INC   SP
        LD    H, (SP)
        INC   SP

Note that you can only PUSH/POP registers in pairs. So if you just want
to store E, you would have to do PUSH DE.\
 Also, you're under no obligation to POP into the same register you
PUSHed. This is perfectly acceptable:

        PUSH   AF
        POP    IX

Here is a sample code fragment that manipulates the stack with a diagram
showing how the stack looks through operation.

        LD     HL, $2145
        PUSH   HL            ;1
        LD     DE, $91FF
        PUSH   DE            ;2
        LD     BC, $0A33
        PUSH   BC            ;3
        POP    AF            ;4
        POP    HL            ;5
        POP    BC

Take care with the stack. Since the operating system also uses the
stack, you really have less than 400 bytes of stack space to work with.
Nevertheless, this should be sufficient for all your needs. What you
should be more concerned about is leaving the stack in the exact same
state is was as when the program started. I don't think I need to tell
you the [ramifications](../ref/crash.html) of not heeding this warning.
