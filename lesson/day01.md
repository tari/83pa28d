# Prerequisites

In order to use this guide, it is recommended that you have some familiarity with C or a
similar programming language. C will be used frequently in this guide as “pseudocode”.

This guide assumes that you have had enough experience with programming to know common
programming terms, such as *directory*, *source code*, and *compiling*.

# Setup

First, you will need to create a directory to store your programs and the tools you will 
need. The method for doing this varies between operating systems.

### Windows
Create a directory in a directory of your choice on your computer and give it a 
descriptive name, such as `ASM` or `Assembly`. In this directory, you should create 
three more directories: one for your program’s source code, one for the assembler that you will use, and one for the assembled programs.

### Mac OS
(Need process description...)

### Linux
(Need process description...)

# Tools

## Source Code Editor

The first tool you will need to create assembly programs is a source code editor. Some 
popular editors are listed below along with their supported operating systems.

1. Notepad
    - OS Support: Windows
    - Included with every installation of Windows, but does not have many features.
2. Notepad++
    - OS Support: Windows
    - Lots of features, and easy to use. 
    - Recommended for inexperienced programmers.
3. Geany
    - OS Support: Windows, Linux
    - Has similar features to Notepad++
    - Only depends on GTK+ without further toolkit dependancies.
4. Vim
    - OS Support: Windows, Mac, Linux
    - The hacker's editor. Extremely powerful, but has a very steep learning curve.

**[ED NOTE]: Editor recommendations welcome.**

## Assembler

An assembler translates source code into machine code that the calculator can execute. In
this guide we will use an assembler called [Brass](http://www.benryves.com/bin/brass/). 
**[CAPTAIN CALC EDIT]: Considering creating SDK for the guide that the reader can use**

The following section will show how to install Brass on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. **[ED NOTE]: The assembler should be placed in the directory for the assembler created beforehand**

## Emulator

An emulator is a program that runs on a computer and simulates a physical
calculator. There are several emulators for the TI-83 Plus, such as [WabbitEmu](https://wabbit.codeplex.com/) and [JsTIfied](https://www.cemetech.net/projects/jstified/).

WabbitEmu is an offline emulator that you can download and install like any other computer
application.

JsTIfied, on the other hand, is an online emulator offered for free by the
computer/calculator enthusiast site, [Cemetech](https://www.cemetech.net/). To use this 
emulator you will need to setup a Cemetech account and have an Internet connection. 
Cemetech also offers a source code editor called [SourceCoder](https://www.cemetech.net/sc/) that allows you to create and save programs on the Cemetech 
site.

### ROM Dumping

Regardless of the emulator you choose, you will need a ROM image in order to use it. A 
ROM image, or simply ROM, is a copy of the calculator's software. To obtain a ROM image
from your TI-83 Plus ("ROM dumping"), you can either use [rom8x](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/373/37341.html) or TiLP. Please note that
you must get the ROM image from a calculator that you own. Obtaining a ROM image from 
anywhere else is illegal. The [README file](https://www.ticalc.org/cgi-bin/zipview?win/rom8x0.3.3.zip;rom8x-0.3.3/README.txt) included
with the rom8x download explains how to dump a ROM from your calculator.


# Creating Your First Program

  
## Editing

Create a new file in your text editor, and copy the following program into it:

```z80
.nolist
#include "ti83plus.inc"
#define ProgStart $9D95
.list
.org ProgStart - 2
.db t2ByteTok, tAsmCmp

    b_call(_ClrLCDFull)
    ld a, 0
    ld (CurRow), a
    ld (CurCol), a
    ld hl, msg
    b_call(_PutS)            ; Display the text
    b_call(_NewLine)
    ret

msg:
    .db "Hello world!", 0
.end
```

**[ED NOTE]: Discuss the potential optimizations: `xor a`, or `ld (CurRow), hl` after
zeroing HL.**

Save this file as `hello.asm` in the directory you created earlier for the source code 
files. If you are using Notepad, it may attempt to save the file as a `.txt` file, giving
it the name: `hello.asm.txt`. If it does, rename the file and save it again.

## Assembling

Once you have saved the file in the appropriate directory...

**[ED NOTE]: Process for assembling source code using Brass**
 
## Running

To run the program, transfer the assembled program to an emulator, using either TI-Connect
or TiLP. When the program is in the emulator, execute `Asm(HELLO` to run the program. If 
all went well, you should see the following image:

![\[NO IMAGE\]](../img/hello.png)

Congratulations, you have created your first ASM program! If the calculator
crashed when you ran the program, check your code for errors and rerun the program.
To recover from a crash, turn the calculator back on and you will see a "RAM Cleared"
message. [Crashes](../ref/crash.html) clear the calculator's RAM and reset the
calculator's settings. Archived variables and programs are not affected by RAM resets.

**[ED NOTE]: Removed the reference to program size. Need to find the
appropriate place to mention it**
